General: 
    - lambda functions in transformations
    - meanVarData __init__

    * Got rid of abstract properties and instead made them part of the abstract class constructor 
    - Why do some functions return objects?
        - Python doesn't copy object instance when passed into funciton, so we may be able to delete that in python version
    - Need to find better way to supress Deprication warning from RandomState or find better random generator
        - Currently supresses all warnings (see header of IntegrationExample.py)
    * MATLAB version sometimes runs out of memory
    * Python Keister's function example working (kinda) and Multilevel Asian Option example NOT working
    (Need to walk through both again throuroughly)
    - Improve function documentation (+ funciton parameter description)
    - Update both readme files (html+md)

    - Check random number generators in python vs MATLAB

        * Should this class be abstract in MATLAB?
    IIDDistribution
        * Now handles the construction of self.distrib_list in a similar way to AsianCallFun
        - In MATLAB, the list of objects is created in the discreteDistribution constructor, 
        but I was having trouble doing this in python
        - TrueD is now an abstract property that is set (for each distrib in the distrib_list) in the IIDDistribution constructor

        - Still needs to be tested and walked through again completely

        - May need better type_checking and less parameters in constructing object

Test Files:
    dt_AsianCallFun
        - Needs test for f function
        - constructor dt passing
    dt_CLTStopping
        - Needs test for stopYet function
        - constructor dt passing
    dt_IIDDistribution
        - Needs tests for initStreams, and genDistrib functions
        * constructor dts 'Expected' matches 'Got' but still won't pass
    dt_integrate
        - None available
    dt_KeisterFun
        - Needs test for g function
        - constructor dt passing

General: 
    - Got rid of abstract properties and instead made them part of the abstract class constructor 
    - Why do some functions return objects?
        - Python doesn't copy object instance when passed into funciton, so we may be able to delete that in python version
    - Need to find better way to supress Deprication warning from RandomState.
        - Or find better random generator

    discreteDistribution
        - What is happening in the constructor?
        - leave creating list of discreteDistributions to concrete classes? 
    fun 
        - Should this class be abstract? 
    IIDDistribution
        - Now handles the construction of self.distrib_list in a similar way to AsianCallFun
        - In MATLAB, the list of objects is created in the discreteDistribution constructor, 
        but I was having trouble doing this in python
        - TrueD is now an abstract property but is set for each distrib in the list in the IIDDistribution constructor
    integrate
    IntegrationExample
        - Still needs to be tested
    KeisterFun
    meanVarData
    measure
        - Need to find a better way to type-check like in MATLAB
        - "obj(ii).measureData.timeVector = p.Results.timeVector{ii};" Is measureData a measure object?
            - Why not "obj(ii).timeVector = p.Results.timeVector{ii};"?
            - May need to change python implementation because measureData is currently just an np.ndarray []

        - Needs test for f function
        - constructor dt passing
    dt_CLTStopping
        - Needs test for stopYet function
        - constructor dt passing
    dt_IIDDistribution
        - Needs tests for __init__, initStreams, and genDistrib functions
        - None available
    dt_integrate
        - None available
    dt_KeisterFun
        - Needs test for g function
        - constructor dt passing
    dt_meanVarData
        - Needs test for updateData function
        - constructor dt passing
    dt_measure
        - Is correct. Not sure why it won't pass. Expected and got are the same.
        - Single and multi-dimensional constructors passing

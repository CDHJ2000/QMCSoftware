Before Release:
    Verify CLT/CLTRep Correctness
    Implement n_total,n_max checks for ALL stopping criterion algorithms
    rel_tol case for mean_mc_g

Asian Option:
    interest rate for Asian Option?
    Can implement call/put and arithmetic/geometric mean options?
    Start an Option class that inherits from Integrand? 

Documentation:
    documentation in both sphinx and docs/ ? 
    How are readme files linked to sphinx documentation? 
    Still need html_from_readme/?

Stopping Criterion:
    all(sighat[i]<abs_tol) sufficient for clt rep? 
    mean_mc_g: 
        when relative tolerance != 0?
        how to extend to multi-level? Tentative solution correct?
